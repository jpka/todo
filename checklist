- I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
not an option.
- I can have my todo list displayed.
- I can mark an entry as completed.
- Assign priorities and due dates to the entries.
- I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries).
- I can sort my entry lists using due date and priority.
- Write a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger actions on your app (same actions available on the webpage).

- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
